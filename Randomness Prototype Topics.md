## 4 topics - 3 to choose
- Random environment (structures / terrain / levels)
- [Random obstacles](Prototyping.md) (enemies / challenges)
- Random abilities (player skills / items / actions)
- ~~Random meaning (storytelling / appearance)~~

3 prototypes per the period

2 prototypes will be different games and the 3rd prototype will be an iteration on the game we like.

After talking we have decided to go first with environment and obstacles for the 2 prototypes and the random abilities for the iteration. We initially wanted to go with obstacles and abilities first because they are easier to make than a random environment. However during thinking of concepts for the games it was always dependent on a different topic. So from a design perspective it will be easier if we just create a prototype for environment and obstacles and then we just add the random abilities to the prototype we like. 

I am trying to work on the prototypes as if I would create a full game from them and not just a throwaway prototype that I would use for the sake of having a prototype and then work on something I want to later.
